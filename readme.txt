About:
The folder "Ubuntu 14 DIG" contains a virtual machine with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS operating system. It comes pre-installed with SAGE, Z3, KLEE, Java, JPF and Junit. Most importantly, it includes DIG or SymInfer - a state of the art tool for generating numerical invariants using symbolic states extracted from a symbolic execution tool (please visit https://bitbucket.org/nguyenthanhvuh/symtraces/wiki/Home to know more). To use the virtual machine, first clone/ download the folder "Ubuntu 14 DIG". After that, please open the configuration file "Ubuntu 14 DIG.vmx" using either "VMware Workstation Player" (available for free for personal use) or "VMware Workstation" (license required). VMware workstation player allows you to run virtual machine for free. Please visit the following link to download the player: https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/12_0.
